# snake-game
It's just as boring as it sounds. If you have ever played the snake game then you know what this is.
<br />
I wanted to try and make it within an hour or less with pure vanilla JS to test my vanilla competency. <br />
The final time ended up being around an hour and 10 minutes due to a few weird bugs
